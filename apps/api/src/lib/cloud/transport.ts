/**
 * Cloud transport — the authenticated wire from a self-hosted instance to
 * api.openship.io. Auth is fully server-side: the user's Openship Cloud
 * session lives (encrypted) in `user_settings.cloud_session_token`; this layer
 * reads it, presents it as a Bearer, and forwards the call.
 *
 * Two scopes, and everything resolves to the first:
 *   - cloudFetch(userId)          → call AS that user. This is the primitive:
 *                                   the connect/identity flow uses it directly,
 *                                   and every org-scoped call ends up here.
 *   - cloudFetchAsOrgOwner(orgId) → resolve the org's cloud-linked OWNER
 *                                   (resolveOrgCloudUserId), then cloudFetch as
 *                                   them. All org operations go through this.
 *
 * No client-side cookies or tokens are ever involved.
